# Full-Stack Weather App

We built a full-stack web application that allows users to search for any city and view its current weather information. The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface.  

This project demonstrates how to connect a frontend React app with a backend Node.js/Express server, and provides an excellent example of a real-world, full-stack project suitable for showcasing on your resume or portfolio.

## Problem Statement

Accessing accurate weather information quickly is important for daily planning, travel, and outdoor activities. Many existing weather apps are either overly complex or not customizable for individual learning and development purposes. This project addresses that gap by creating a lightweight, visually appealing web app that allows users to search any city and instantly receive key weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.

## Key Features

1. Users can input any city and retrieve current weather data.  
2. Displays city name, temperature in Celsius, weather description, and humidity.  
3. Clean, modern, and responsive UI with visually appealing gradient backgrounds and centered layout.  
4. Fully functional without any images or additional assets—pure CSS styling.  
5. Demonstrates a working connection between a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

## Methodologies

To build this solution, we used:

- **Frontend:** React for building the user interface and handling user input.  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express to handle API requests and communicate with OpenWeatherMap.  
- **Data Fetching:** Axios for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.  
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS for gradient backgrounds, centered layouts, rounded input fields and buttons, and shadowed weather cards.  
- **Deployment Ready:** Can be easily deployed as a full-stack app with no database required.

## Data Sources

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) – free API providing live weather information globally.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Axios  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Styling:** CSS  
- **Other Tools:** Git/GitHub for version control
